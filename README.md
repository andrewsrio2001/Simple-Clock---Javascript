**JavaScript CSS Clock**

This project, titled "JS-Clock," is a dynamic and visually appealing clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock retrieves the current time using JavaScript and updates the clock hands - hour, minute, and second - accordingly. The hands move smoothly to reflect the passage of time, providing users with an accurate representation of the current time. This project serves as a demonstration of how to create an interactive and functional clock using web technologies.
